Job-Scheduler
=============
A task scheduling program written in Java that uses JSON responses. Optimized for multi-threaded handling of many simultaneous requests. This application aims to categorize tasks based on what other tasks each task is dependent on having finished before they can be made available. It aims to prioritize tasks that unlock the most other tasks first in order to prevent bottlenecks. Thus this is not a FIFO style queing program, but one built for overall speed.#

Installation and Setup (Docker)
================
This project makes use of docker to make deployment incredibly simple and easy. This should be able to be deployed to any docker compatible host. 
* Navigate to the "docker" folder at the top of the source tree and run `bash build.sh`. 
* Start the container by running bash start-container.sh which will start the program on port 3901, but obviously you can use your own docker startup command to have the service listen to and report on any port that you desire.

Warnings & Limitations
======================
* This software is developed in a manner that intends to be deployed on a computer/server that has at least two cores, or a single core with hyperthreading. Although it may be able to cope with running on a single-core computer, that should never be a requirement of the system that restricts the software development in any way.
* The software is designed to hold everything in memory rather than using any databases for performance reasons. This makes installation easy, but causes loss of data if the program exits unexpectedly, such as a due to a reboot. There are plans to extend the application to allow the user to send a shutdown request to gracefully stop the scheduler, and a request to export or save all the tasks so that it can carry on again at a later point in time.

Reason For Development
======================
I needed an application that would be able to gracefully handle many simultaneous requests for work, whilst having greater control over how tasks were orgainzed. This application's primary goal was to have a concept of tasks being dependent on other tasks having been completed before being available to be executed. Initially this project was written in PHP for ease of development, but was moved to Java for the the performance and multi-threaded capabilities. Other languages could have been used, but Java has a similar syntax to PHP, and is fairly easy to build multi-threaded applications with. 

Licencing Information
=====================
This project currently uses the Google-gson 2.2.4 library and has been fully included with licencing in the libs folder. That part of the project uses Apache 2.0 licence which is why this project uses the GPL v3.0 licence which is stated to be compatible. The reason I chose this licence is on the understanding that it expects extensions/updates of the software to also be made opensource. It appears that opensource licences have become extremely complicated, and dull the joys of developing opensource software for others to use.
